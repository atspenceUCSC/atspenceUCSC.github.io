    <h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>

    <div id="challenge">
      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>For this lab, I made an array of all the ways I get around and an object for my main ride (my car). Then I used document.writeln() to show them on the page.</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>It was a little confusing at first to print out the object, since it just says [object Object] if you do it the way I would have expected. I learned you can use JSON.stringify to make it readable. Also, remembering all the brackets and commas for arrays and objects took a few tries.</p>
