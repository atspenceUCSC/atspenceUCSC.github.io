      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>for this lab we were asked to go back to earlier work and try to debug anything that wasn't working or seemed broken. i used the javascript console and chrome tools to check the output and errors in each page and script. i focused on making the web pages styled better and more consis</p>

    <div class="problems">
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>some labs had broken links or didn't load the scripts. in lab 3 the script src was wrong and in lab 6 one of the arrays wasn't printing correctly. a few of my console.logs weren't showing anything so i used alerts and console testing to figure out what line was broken. i also found some inconsistent indentation cleaned </p>
    </div>

    <div class="results">
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>i fixed the things that weren't working and updated js files and css format to reflect what ive learned since doing the first few labs</p>

      <div class="lab-fix">
        <h3>Lab 3</h3>
        <p>in lab 3 i had the wrong path to my javascript file. it was looking for script.js but my file was named lab3.js. i fixed the src attribute in the script tag and now the functions work properly. i also added proper indentation to make the code more readable</p>


      <div class="lab-fix">
        <h3>Lab 6</h3>
        <p>in lab 6 my array wasn't printing to the console right. i had a typo in the variable name and the console.log was in the wrong place. i moved it inside the function and fixed the spelling. also cleaned up the code formatting</p>
