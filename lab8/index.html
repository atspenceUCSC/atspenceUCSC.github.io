  <h1>Lab 8: Anonymous Functions and Callbacks</h1>
  <div id="challenge">
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>I tried out callback functions in JavaScript, like using map() with different functions. I thought t was annoying that you had to open the console to check if the code was working, so I added a basic output to the page to make it easier to see the results.</p>

  <div id="problems">
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>Had trouble with the syntax for map() had to keep looking it up. Also kept forgetting good formatting.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="results">
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>To see the results of this lab, open your browser's JavaScript console. The script will print the original array of numbers, the results of using a named function (square) with map, and the results of using an anonymous function (add 5) with map. All results are printed using console.log so you can see each step of the process. The output will also appear below:</p>
