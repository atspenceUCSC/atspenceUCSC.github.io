  <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>

  <div id="challenge">
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>For this lab, I wanted to use JavaScript conditionals to sort people into houses based on their name. I used if/else logic and a little math to make it work.</p>

  <div id="problems">
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>I had to look up how to use modulus and make sure my function worked for all names. It took a few tries to get the output to show up right.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="results">
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <label for="input">Please enter your name for sorting:</label>
    <input type="text" id="input">
    <button id="button">Sort Me</button>
