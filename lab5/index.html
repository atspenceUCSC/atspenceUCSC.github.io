            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>For this lab, I worked with JavaScript variables and data types. I created variables to store information about my car and learned how to use document.writeln() to display them on a webpage.</p>

        <div id="problems">
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>The main challenge was figuring out how to properly format the output with document.writeln(). I had to remember to add the "<br>" tags to make each piece of information appear on a new line. I also had to make sure all my variables were declared before using them, but ive done a little C++ before so it wasnt too bad.</p>
